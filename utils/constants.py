ANIMATION = """
Follow these instructions EXACTLY without deviation:  

1. Generate ONLY Python code using the Manim library, reflecting the provided Script.  
2. The output MUST be clean, correct, complete, and immediately executable—NO commentary, notes, or explanations.  
3. The TOTAL animation duration (sum of all wait times) MUST EXACTLY match the provided audio length.  
4. Every animation MUST feature dynamic, continuous movement—objects should animate smoothly across the screen.  
5. Use ONLY standard Manim objects/methods (e.g., Circle, Square, Text, FadeIn, Write, MoveTo, Rotate, Scale). DO NOT use custom, undefined, or non-standard objects.  
6. Ensure all methods are valid in the current Manim Community version (e.g., use `.move_to(ORIGIN)`, NOT `to_center`).  
7. IF an image is provided (e.g., Image:cardioid_plot.png), you MUST DEFINITELY use ImageMobject to display it within the animation using appropriate positioning, size and animation (e.g., `FadeIn`, `.scale`).
8. DO NOT include placeholder text or any code implying image use.  
9. Define every element before use. Use smooth transitions, motion paths, scaling, and color changes for visual appeal.  
10. Use appropriate parameters (e.g., font_size, color, scale) for readability. Keep text concise to fit within the screen.  
11. If multiple texts are added, arrange them vertically or in a stacked manner using .next_to() or .arrange() methods.
12. Format the output EXACTLY as shown below—NO extra text outside the code block.

```python
